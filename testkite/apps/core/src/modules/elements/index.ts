/**
 * Module: elements
 * Owned tables: elm_ (screens, elements, usages)
 *
 * Rules (docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md §4):
 *  - FORWARD calls along the DAG = import the facade (this file). BACKWARD/SIDEWAYS calls = domain event via transactional outbox.
 *  - No other module may touch this module's tables (enforced by ownership.json + eslint-boundaries).
 *  - Repositories must be constructed with TenantContext (fail-closed) — see isolation layer L1.
